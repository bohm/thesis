\section{Tightness of the analysis}

We note that the analysis of our algorithm is tight, i.e., if we
reduce the capacity of the bins below 18, the algorithm
fails. Consider the following instance. Send two items of size 6
which are in the first phase packed separately into two bins. Then
send $m-1$ items of size 12. One of them must be put into a bin
with an item of size 6, i.e., one bin receives items of size 18, while
all the items can be packed into $m$ bins of size 12.

To decrease the upper bound below $1.5$ seems challenging. In
particular, the instance above and its modifications with more items
of size 6 or slightly smaller items at the beginning shows that these
items need to be packed in pairs. This in turns creates difficulties
that, in the current approach, lead to new item and bin types; at this
point we do not know if such an approach is feasible.

% Another possible research direction is to improve the lower bounds, in
% particular for large $m$. It is quite surprising that there are no
% lower bounds for $m>5$ larger than the easy bound of $4/3$.

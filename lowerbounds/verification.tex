\section{Verification of the results}\label{sec:4:verification}

\todo{Rewrite this.}

We give a compact representation of our game tree for the lower bound
of $45/33$ for $m=3$, which can be found in Appendix
\ref{sec:appendix}. The fully expanded representation, as given by our
algorithm, is a tree on 11053 vertices.

%TODO: exact number of vertices
For our lower bounds of $19/14$ for $m=4$ and $m=5$, the sheer size of
the tree (e.g. 4665 vertices for a compact representation for $m = 5$) prevents us from
presenting the game tree in its entirety.

We include the lower bound along with the implementations, publishing
it online at
\url{https://github.com/bohm/binstretch/}.

We have implemented a simple independent C++ program which verifies
that a given game tree is valid and accurate. While verifying our
lower bound manually may be laborious, verifying the correctness of
the C++ program should be manageable. The verifier is available along
with the rest of the programs and data.

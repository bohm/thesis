\subsection{Verification}

For our lower bounds of $19/14$ for $4 \le m \le 9$ we do not have a
printable version of the game tree, as it contains too many vertices.

However, we include the lower bounds in the \texttt{graphviz}
representation as part of our software appendix. We have published the
lower bound software and the lower bound data at
\url{https://github.com/bohm/binstretch/}.

Our lower bound implementation is extremely large in terms of number
of lines of code and we cannot in good faith vouch for it to not
contain any errors. At the same time, we do not expect the reader
to check all the lower bound trees by hand, even though it is possible
for a smaller tree such as the one in the next section.

To that end, we have implemented a simple independent C++ program
which verifies that a given game tree is valid winning strategy for
the player \adversary and that all possible options of player \algo
are present. While verifying our lower bound manually may be
laborious, erifying the correctness of the C++ program should be
manageable. The verifier is available along with the lower bound
search code and lower bound data.

\section{Lower bound instance}\label{sec:4:instance}

This section contains an explicit graphical representation of the
lower bound of $45/33$ for $3$ bins.

  \caption{The beginning moves of the $45/33$ lower bound, scaled so
      that $T = 33$ and $S = 45$. The vertices contain the current
      loads of all three bins, and a string \texttt{n: $i$} with $i$
      being the next item presented by the \adversary. If there are
      several numbers after \texttt{n:}, the items are presented in
      the given order, regardless of packing by the player \algo. The coloured vertices are expanded in later figures.}

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Tables~\ref{tab:results3} and \ref{tab:resultsmulti} summarize our
results. The paper of Gabay, Brauner and Kotov \cite{gabay2013lbv2}
contains results up to the denominator 20; we include them in the
table for completeness. Results after the denominator 20 are new. Note
that there may be a lower bound of size say $\frac{41}{30}$ even
though none was found with this denominator; for example, some lower
bound may reach $41/30$ using item sizes that are not multiples of
$1/30$.

\caption[LoF entry]{The results and performance of our linear and
parallel computations for \binstretch with three bins. The results
above the horizontal line were previously shown in \cite{gabay2013lbv2}, the
rest are our results. The column \textit{L. b.} indicates whether a
lower bound was found when starting with the given stretching factor
$R/S$ as seen in column \textit{Fraction}.

The column \textit{Mon.} shows the lowest monotonicity that our
program needs to find a lower bound. In the case of negative results,
time measurements were done only using full generality, i.e. with
monotonicity $S-1$.

Some fractions below $112/82$ are omitted; our lower bound computation
has not found a lower bound on those.

The linear results were computed on a server with an AMD Opteron 6134
CPU and 64496 MB RAM. The size of the hash table was set to $2^{25}$
with chain length $4$.

The parallel results were computed using OpenMPI on a heterogenous
cluster with $109$ worker processes running.

The output of the program was not generated during the
time measurements.}

\caption{Results produced by our minimax algorithm in the case of $4$
and $5$ bins.  Tested on the same machine and with the same parameters
as in Table~\ref{table:results}, both for linear and parallel
computations. In columns \textit{Mon.} and \textit{Parallel}, we list
in brackets monotonicity and elapsed time of computation for an input
having an item of size 5 at the start. Monotonicity is measured only
starting with the second item.}

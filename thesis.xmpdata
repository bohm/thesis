\Title{Online Bin Stretching: Algorithms and Computer Lower Bounds}
\Keywords{bin stretching\sep online scheduling\sep bin packing\sep online algorithms\sep computer search}
\Subject{
We investigate a problem in semi-online algorithm design, called
Online Bin Stretching. The problem can be understood as an online
repacking problem: the goal of the algorithm is to repack items of
various sizes into $m$ containers of identical size R>1. The input
items arrive one by one and the algorithm must assign an item to a
container before the next item arrives.
A speciality of this problem is that there is a specific guarantee
made to the algorithm: the algorithm learns at the start of the input
that there exists a packing of all input items into m containers of
capacity 1.
Our goal is to design algorithms for this problem which successfully
pack the entire incoming sequence one by one while requiring the
lowest container capacity R possible.
In this thesis, we show several new results about Online Bin
Stretching: First, we design an algorithm that is able to pack the
entire input into m containers of capacity 1.5 regardless of what
the vale of m will be. Second, we show a specialized algorithm for
the setting of just 3 containers; this algorithm is able to pack
into 3 bins of capacity 1.375. Finally, we design and implement an
involved search algorithm which is able to find lower bounds for
Online Bin Stretching -- and in fact we show the best known lower
bounds for 3 <= m <= 9.}
